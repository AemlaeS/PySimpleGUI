**Control Panel**

Creates a grid of images with text labels that looks like a typical "control panel".  

Note that there is currently a bug with the `Column` Element where the mousewheel only scrolls the Column if mouse is directrly over the scrollwheel.

This code contains a lot of Base64 Images in order to avoid needing to distributes a lot of individual image files with the code.  This way a single source file has everything required.

On Windows the window looks like this:
