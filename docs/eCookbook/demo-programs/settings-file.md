### Settings File - Load & Save Programming Settings

This demo program shows one way to save your program's settings using a JSON file as your settings file.  This code is particularly handy when you are building desktop-widgets like a Rainmater type of desktop widget.

The main program in the example is very small.  The focus is on the settings window.

This is the settings window.

Now you can easily add settings to your programs that are saved to disk, a very nice touch that adds a lot of polish to your programs.
