## UserSettings as a Simple Database

The UserSettings API can be used to store data like you would find in a database.  Each entry in a UserSetting entry is a key to some data.  In the case of this databsae example, that data is another dictionary that contains infomation about the entry.

Tbis Demo Program shows a simple database that uses a "User ID" as the key, and there are a number of informational fields associated with each UserID.  This informatoin is stored as a dictionary to make accessing the data simple.
