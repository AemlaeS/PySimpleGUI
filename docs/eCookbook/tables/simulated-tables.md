This is a subset of the larger Table Simulation program that you'll also find on Trinket.  This smaller demo shows a table and enables moving around with arrow keys.

The larger demo includes the ability to sort columns.  The reason for 2 demos.... make one that's smaller in case that's what you need.  It removes the need for you to strip out unwanted code and you can instead begin to add your code to this smaller base of code.
