Dragging Stuff Around

This is where the Graph Element really begins to open up some powerful applications.  In this short drawing we're creating a paint program where you can drag with your mouse to create shapes and move them around on the Graph surface.

Also demonstrated are the cursors that can be set.  When moving things, the dursor is changed into a movement cursor.  

To run the program without the code on the screen, use this link to get a much larger view:
