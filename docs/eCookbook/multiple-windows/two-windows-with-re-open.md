## Multiple Windows  - Re-open Capability

This demo uses the `read_all_windows` function (avilable only on the tkinter port currently)

Each window has the ability to update the other.  Additionally, Window 1 has a button to re-open Window 2 should you close Window 2.

Here is how the program looks on Windows
