**Conway's Game Of Life**

This demo is an adaptation of a text based Game of Life.  The PySimpleGUI code was added to an existing engine.  The GUI code is pretty well isolated, especially the board creation / setup code which is in a couple of class methods.  

It demonstrates utilizing a `Graph` element to draw rectanges based on user mouse clicks.  This kind of interface works well on both a traditional window + mouse setup or on a tablet's touchscreen.

This same code can be run on Android for example using PyDroid3.

The "Published" version of this code can be found here:

It's the same output but done in a full-window, without the code being shown.
