# Wordle

A front-end for the popular Wordle game

You will need to add some additional code to hook up to a dictionary of words.  This Trinket has the code to handle all of the user input & output.  It takes in characters, converts to upper case, handles backspace key and enter key.  It also color codes the submitted answer against the "Current word" (currently a single constant).
