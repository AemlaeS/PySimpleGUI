This short PySimpleGUI program is under 40 lines of code and implements the first row of controls.  On Windows, the special characters (arrows) show up correctly.  On Trinket they do not and will in fact give you an error if you click on one of these buttons.

This is how the program looks when run on Windows

VERY little time was spent creatring and even less time spent polishing it.  Stuff doesn't line up perfectly, etc.  Like any GUI, time needs to be spent making these kinds of fine adjustments.  The point here was to show something representative quickly.
