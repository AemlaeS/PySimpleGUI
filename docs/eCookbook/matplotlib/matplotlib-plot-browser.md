This Demo Program was adapted to run on Trinket by shrinking down the size of the display window from 650,650 to 500,500.  Shrinking the area makes the plots look a little crowded.  

These screenshots are from Windows.  Click on the list on the left to view a plot.

Slide up the "pane" on the bottom to reveal the source code for the plot you're viewing.

Your application doesn't have to be this fancy.  You could display your raw data in the hidden pane so that you can slide it up and view the underlying data.
