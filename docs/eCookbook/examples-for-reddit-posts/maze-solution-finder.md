A Maze Solution Finding Algorithm

This program was initialy posted to Reddit as a command line application that produced a folder full of PNG files representing the maze solution.  It was only after you concatenated these images together to create a flip-book style movie that you got an appreciation of the graphics.

Rather than outputting these PNG files to a folder, how about outputting them to a GUI window?  

That's where the idea of adding on a GUI came to be.  An hour later and this was the result.

You are first asked to choose the TXT file representing the maze.

Then you'll be shown the maze and an animation of it being solved.

Here is how it looks running on windows:
