**The Classic Simple Calculator **

This program is the beginning of a typical calculator.  It was done to see what creating one in PySimpleGUI versus tkinter looked like.

A full-blown calculator was not completed.  This was an exercise meant to duplicate the look and operation of the GUI, not the entire program.  The things that are operational are:

* Numeric entry via buttons
* Numeric entry via keyboard
* Clear display using CE button

All of the other buttons are generating events, the logic hasn't been added to do somethiuung with the button click.

The goal was to duplicate this GUI

On windows the PySimpleGUI code produced this program
