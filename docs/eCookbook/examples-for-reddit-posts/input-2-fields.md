A simple GUI with 2 inputs for this Reddit post:

The window will be shown until a button is clicked or closed with an "X".  This is called a "One Shot" window.  Add an event loop if you want more user interaction.

You can add more advanced features such as adding a popup call to get the date, or adding a Date Chooser button to choose the date.  This will be easier for the user and will automatically do a bit of validation of the input.
