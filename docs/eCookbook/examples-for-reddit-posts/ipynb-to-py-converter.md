## Quick Mock-up of a Tkinter GUI Posted on Reddit

It's always a fun exercise to see what it takes to duplicate a GUI written using another framework.  It's great practice and I learn something from the original author's work every time.

This one was unique in that most tkinter GUIs are not as responsive.  The text color for the checkboxes changes to either green or red immediately upon making a selection.  It's a clever touch that I don't recall seeing in another tkinter GUI.  Kudo's to the original author.

There is an extra line of code required to set the icon because this example is running on Trinket. 

All credit for this GUI's design goes to Github User saikatsahana77
