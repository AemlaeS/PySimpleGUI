**Popup Window with Delayed Text Output**

The idea here is to present text on a character by character basis... as if someone was typing it on a keyboard or "saying" something in a text based adventure game.

This Reddit mockup is based on this post:

The user can interrupt the message causing the window to close immediate, or they can wait for the entire message to be displayed and then close the window.  An option could be added that would cause the full text to be displayed on the first button click and then the second click will close the window.

On Windows this is how the window appears:
