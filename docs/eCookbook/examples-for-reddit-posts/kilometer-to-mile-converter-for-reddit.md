Sometimes little programs are written to demonstrate concepts for Reddit posts.
These make good teaching tools so you'll find a few have made it onto the list.

This program demonstrates simple input from and output to a window. Additionally
a couple of parameters are used to "complete" the interface so that it's nice
for the user.  Think for a moment about how people will use your GUI... take a
moment to design it.  There were 2 options in this program that were nice
finishing touches.  
1. The return key signals the user has completed input
2. After the output is displayed, the input field is cleared for the next entry

This program also uses the `change_look_and_feel` call to quickly add some color
to the window.
