A Mockup Of Another Reddit Project

This is an ideal project for PySimpleGUI.  OK, so maybe it's claimed for just about every GUI problem, but only when it fits.  And for this project, it fits.

The Redit post where this project was mentioned:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ee6n53/advice_on_code_before_i_make_it_bigger/

And here's the project's GitHub:

What made this project especially appealing to add a GUI onto is the fact that it was written in a well-structured manner.  All of the input was isolated in a single file.  It was easy to go from that file to a GUI.

At the end of the function the values dictionry is returned.
